There is a Jupyter notebook for each separate problem on this assignment.

1. HW 1-1: HW1-1_Deep_vs_Shallow.ipynb
1. HW 1-2: HW1-2_Optimization.ipynb
1. HW 1-3: HW1-3_Generalization.ipynb

Running these in order will produce the desired results. Or, the latest results used in the report can be seen here.

`common` contains the class definitions for the models and Pytorch Dataset for creating the data for my nonlinear function $e^x \cdot sin^2(3 \pi x)$.

`data` contains the MNIST dataset

`results` contains subdirectories for each problem (`1`, `2`, and `3`) with the figures for each respectively
